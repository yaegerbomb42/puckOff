    # Connected to the same network as Nginx Proxy Manager (usually default bridge if not specified, 
    # but best to be explicit if NPM is on a custom network. Assuming default bridge overlap or direct port exposure for now).
    # Since NPM is likely on "puckoff_default" network, we need to join it or expose ports.
    # Exposing ports locally is safer for NPM to reach via host IP or internal Docker IP.
